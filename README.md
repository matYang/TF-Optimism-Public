# TF-Optimism-Public
Public repo for contracts TokenFunder is seeking to deploy onto Optimism.

This repo is created to satisfy Optimism onboarding requirements.

The contracts have been flattened with truffle-flattener. The flattened versions contain the exact code that was deployed onto Optimism Kovan.

Mapping from contract name to address on Optimism Kovan is kept here: https://gist.github.com/matYang/8321c7d74ce5f087b2da04e124bdbb71

All the contracts are verified on Etherscan.
